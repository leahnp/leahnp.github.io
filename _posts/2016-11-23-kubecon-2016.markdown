### My first developers conference!

After working since September on the Samsung Cloud Native Computing team, I had the chance to go to Kubecon in Seattle, WA. We use Kubernetes daily so Kubecon was a great chance to see how other companies are using Kubernetes and the technologies growing around it. 

The Cloud Native Computing Foundation posted a blog I wrote about my experience [HERE](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2016/11/18/diversity-scholarship-series-time-cloudnativecon-2016).
